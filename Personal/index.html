		Here is my self-introduction.

			<section>Part 1</section>
			<p>Hiya! Nice to meet you! My name is Yi-Hua Chiao, but most of my friends just call me Sophie. I am a junior from NTHU, double majoring in Foreign Languages and Literature and also Economics. </p>
				<section>Part 2</section>
				<p>I am passionate, imaginative and love exploring. I devoted a great amount of my free time to Aboriginal Cultural Club, where members hold summer and winter camps for aboriginal kids from rural mountain areas of Hsinchu. We also stayed at local tribe for two weeks during the summer vacation. It was a memorable period of time, when I discovered and learned new things every day. We help with farm work at dawn, and play with the children in the afternoon. We also cooked for ourselves and boiled the water we needed for shower with bamboo.</p>
				<p>Other than that, I enjoy listening to indie music and going to music festivals and live concert in my free time. The music composed by local Taiwanese bands are mesmerizing, and each band has exclusive, distinct styles. I reflect a lot from their music and learn to feel the world I am living through the songs.</p>
				<p>I also LOVE what I am learning at NTHU a lot. Beside my majors, I have also taken several classes about anthropology, gender/sex and art. I am also learning programming:)
