					<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
					<p>In the opening paragraph<a href="example.html#sec1"> [Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases <q>before symptoms emerge</q> indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.</p>
					<p class ="quote"><q>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that <span style="background-color:#80cdc1;"> the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge</span>.</q></p>
